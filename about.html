        I’ve been playing tennis for about 11 years—earlier at a professional level, now amateur for fun.
        I also go to the gym regularly. I enjoy moving, staying fit, and living an active lifestyle.

        <h1>Tech Passion</h1>
        My passion is computer science and mathematics—especially creating things from scratch that stand out and help
        in daily tasks. I enjoy building applications and backend systems. I love Java and Python, and I’m also comfortable with C.

      <div class="item">
        <h1>Experience</h1>
        I have team experience working in Scrum on a geography-learning app with flashcards, quizzes, and user statistics.
        In my free time, I turn my ideas into code as solo projects (see Projects). I also teach mathematics at a high level.
